## What is SmartClean Audits

Audits allows you to perform the following actions:
- **Create audits (_inspections_)**: Define inspection templates by utilising various question-answer formats available and allocate scores alongwith failure threshold definitions.
- **Get inspection analytics**: Get insights into which zones are performing best or worst by visualizing daily, weekly or monthly reports that churn out average scores and failed item details.

## Creating Inspection Templates

Inspection templates can be defined by going to the [_Templates_](/templatesAudits.html) section of your dashboard.
