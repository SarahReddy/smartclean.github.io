*These reports allow custom analytics and data to be presented using SmartClean's proprietary BI services.*

Note: The two controllers in above image are for BI Reports (as you can see from the icon under column: Report Type)

## Special Properties
In additional to the common SmartClean Report Actions, BI Report controllers support the following: 
- **Run or Open in BI Context:**
  - Opens the report in the BI Context (Redirects to a SmartClean Matrix BI visualization page)
  - This additional action is visible as the fourth button under the column Actions for both the BI Report controllers
  - If the user account that is currently signed in is not authorized to view BI reports, new web page will ask for sign in.
