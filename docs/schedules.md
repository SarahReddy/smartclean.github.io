## Creating shifts

Shifts can be created by going to the _Schedules_ section of your dashboard.

The steps involved in creating a shift are enumerated below:

1. Click on the **&#x2B;** icon in the dashboard. Note that the icon is only visible for future dates as nothing can be planned for past dates.

2. Start by selecting the start date time and subsequently the end date time. Note that a shift may span night hours, therefore the end time can be carried over to the next day as shown below.

3. The shift can be allocated to one or more zones in the facility by selecting the level followed by the zone.
**Note:** The zone selection can be left empty to indicate availability of this shift as a recepient of incidents for all zones.

4. Select breaks (_optional_). Breaks are of 2 types:
  - Unplanned breaks: Specify the time allocated to this break. A person can start and end this break at any time during their shift.
  - Planned breaks: Specify the start and end time for this break. The mobile application will remind the person to start this type of break few minutes before its scheduled start time.
  **Note:** The system will not send any auto assigned incidents (IoT driven) during this duration.
