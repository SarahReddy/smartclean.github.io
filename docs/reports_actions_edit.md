  - *Recipients:* Email address of intended users to where this report should be sent. 
  - *Time Zone:* Choose the desired timezone (by default it is the current region)

  - *Message:* A text to be added as the body of the Email that is sent.
  - *Description:* A text describing what the report represents.
