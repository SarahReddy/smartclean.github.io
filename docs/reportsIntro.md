A reporting service is a collection of various standard Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) rendered as charts or tables.
Reporting services are of various types depending on how they are rendered. Currently, there are three types of reporting services:
- BI Embedded (Business Intelligence): BI embedded reports allow custom analytics and data to be presented using SmartClean's proprietary BI services.
- Web Report: Web based reports are snapshots of data and analytics at a certain time. Such reports can be shared with users not having Matrix logins.
- PDF Report: PDF reporting services generate a PDF that can be shared with users over various communication mediums.
