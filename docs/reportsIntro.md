# What is a reporting service
A reporting service is a collection of various standard Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) rendered as charts or tables.

Various systems and services from SmartClean Matrix can be configured to generate reports via our Reporting Service.

Depending on who are the intended users and the service which provides the data, this service can generate reports of various types.

To access this service via your SmartClean Matrix web application,
click on the Reports icon that looks like a gear on blue navigation panel towards the left.

If there are any reports available for your Building or Property, they will show up on this screen.

As seen on the above image, this sample report is from our Audits Service.

Currently, this service shows three types of reports:
- BI Embedded (Business Intelligence): These reports allow custom analytics and data to be presented using SmartClean's proprietary BI services.
- Web Report: These reports are snapshots of data and analytics at a certain time. Such reports can be shared with users not having Matrix logins.
- PDF Report (Document): These reports are available as a PDF document that can be shared with users over various communication mediums.
