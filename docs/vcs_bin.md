# Bin Monitoring Solution
*This solution generates an alert when the estimate level of contents inside the bin being monitored has reached a set level*

## How does this Solution work
To activate our Bin Monitoring Solution, the following steps are required.

1. Install and activate SmartClean Bin Monitoring Sensor inside desired Garbage Bin at desired Location in your Facility.
   - For Example: Install and activate a Bin Sensor inside each garbage bin in washrooms of your facility.
   
2. Define details of recipients who should receive notifications about Bin getting filled up events.
   - For Example: A cleaning attendant to receive SMS and supervisor to receive Mobile App Notification

3. Your trash bin will raise an alert when the empty space remaining inside it reaches the minimum level.

4. The alert indicates that the trash bin is becoming full.
