# Bin monitoring solution
*This solution generates an alert when the estimate fill level of (contents inside) the bin being monitored has reached a set level*

## How does this solution work
To activate our bin monitoring solution, the following steps are required.

1. Install and activate SmartClean bin monitoring sensor inside desired bin at a zone in your facility.
   - For Example: Install and activate a bin sensor inside each garbage bin in washrooms of your facility.

2. The bin being monitored will raise an incident when the empty space remaining inside it reaches the minimum level.

3. The alert indicates that the trash bin is becoming full.
