# Usage monitoring solution
*This solution creates an incident when the number of people entered the enclosed zone reaches a set threshold*

## How does this solution work
To activate our usage monitoring solution, the following steps are required.

1. Install and activate SmartClean people counting sensor at desired enclosed zones in your facility.

2. The zone will generate an incident when people counted by the device in its detection zone reaches the maximum threshold.

3. The incident indicates that the number of people who entered the zone is more than expected.

Some of our other solutions which generate incidents are:
- [Indoor air quality monitoring](/vcs_aq.html)
- [Spill detection](/vcs_wd.html)
- [Feedback reporting](/vcs_fd.html)
- [Consumable monitoring](/vcs_cmd.html)
