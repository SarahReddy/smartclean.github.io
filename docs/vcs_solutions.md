# Solutions

## What are Matrix Solutions
*Matrix Solutions are Facility Management use cases that are supported by our Matrix platform*

Most of our Solutions use SmartClean VCS to create Work Orders to capture and alert intended recipients about 
desired events.

## How do Matrix Solutions work
For a specific use case to be handled by our Matrix platform, the following steps are necessary

1. Introduce data sources for various needs in your Facility.
   - For Example: Introduce SmartClean Device for Monitoring Air Quality.

2. Assign data source to a specific Location in the Facility.
   - For Example: A Washroom or Meeting Room at a certain level in your building.
   
3. Define details of recipients who should receive notifications about desired event
   - For Example: A cleaning attendant to receive SMS and supervisor to receive Mobile App Notification

4. Done! Your Facility Management need has just been made smarter with our Solution.

As VCS detects desired events for this Solution in this Location, Work Orders will be generated based on default settings.

Some of our solutions which generate Work Orders are:
1. [Air Quality Monitoring](/vcs_aq.html)
2. [Usage Monitoring](/vcs_pc.html)
3. [Spill Detection](/vcs_wd.html)
4. [Bad Feedback Reporting]()
5. [Consumable Monitoring]()
6. [Bin Fill Level Sensing]()
