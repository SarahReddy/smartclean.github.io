# Solutions

## What are Solutions
*Solutions are applications running in a property which listen to events and sensor data of the property to result in some actionable outcomes or insights.*

For example most of our Solutions create incidents and notify intended recipients about desired events.

## How do these work
1. Data sources from the site collect and send data to the cloud in real time
2. Systems integrated to the platform listen for these data and events
   - For example, the smart toilet system analyses these events for creating incidents
3. Just install, describe and activate the data sources, our platform handles the rest.
4. As Optimus detects desired events for this solution in this zone, incidents will be created based on default values of [solution settings](/vcs_settings.html)
5. You may view these incidents in your [SmartClean matrix application](/index.html)
