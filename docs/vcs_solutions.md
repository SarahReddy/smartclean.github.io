# Solutions

## What are Solutions
*These are solutions to problems in a facility, such as sensing and monitoring desired aspects in a location.*

Most of our Solutions use SmartClean Optimus to create incidents and notify intended recipients about 
such desired events.

## How do these work
In order to make your facility management requirement smart with our platform, the following steps are necessary:

1. Introduce data sources for the various needs in your Facility.
   - For Example: Introduce a SmartClean Device for Monitoring Air Quality.

2. Assign data source to a specific Location in the Facility.
   - For Example: A Washroom or Meeting Room at a certain level in your building.
   
3. Define details of recipients who should receive notifications about desired event
   - For Example: A cleaning attendant to receive SMS and supervisor to receive Mobile App Notification

4. Done! Your Facility Management need has just been made smarter with our Solution.

As Optimus detects desired events for this Solution in this Location, 
Alerts will be generated based on default values of [Alert Settings](/vcs_settings.html)

You may view these Alerts in your [SmartClean Matrix Application](/index.html)
