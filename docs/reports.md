# SmartClean Reporting Service
*Our Reporting Service allows users to configure, display and share SmartClean Reports using standard controls*

Our **Reports** are a collection of various standard Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) of a desired aspect,
rendered as appropriate charts or tables for efficient visualization of the aspect.

To access this service in your [SmartClean Matrix Web Portal](https://www.smartclean.io/matrix/sso),
click on the Reports icon that looks like a gear on blue navigation panel towards the left.

If there are any report controllers available for your Building or Property, they will show up on this page.

Depending on the service which provides the data, and intended users this service can create controllers
for [reports of various types](/reportTypes.html).

Various services in SmartClean Matrix can be configured so that report controllers become available for locations where
the service is active.

In general, each report controller allows you to perform the following actions:
- **View Report**: You can use the module to view the timeseries data of reports generated by the reporting services enabled in your project.
- **Execute Report**: Some Reports can be executed on demand based on a custom date time selection hence giving you the flexibility to choose the data and analytics time range as required.
- **Share Report**: SmartClean Web Reports can be shared via a permalink with people that is password protected and can be accessed by anyone who has been provided the password.
