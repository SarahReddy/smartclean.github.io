## What is SmartClean Reports

Reports allows you to perform the following actions:
- **View standard reports enabled**: You can use the module to view the timeseries data of reports generated by the reporting services enabled in your project.
- **Execute certain reports on demand**: Some reporting services can be executed based on a custom date time selection hence giving you the flexibility to choose the data and analytics time range as required.
- **Share with external users**: Web type reporting services allow you to share a permalink with people that is password protected and can be accessed by anyone who has been provided the password.
