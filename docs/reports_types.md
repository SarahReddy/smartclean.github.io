# What are the Report Types
*Depending on who are the intended users and the service which provides the data, this service can generate reports of various types.*

Our reporting service shows three types of reports:
- BI Embedded (Business Intelligence): These reports allow custom analytics and data to be presented using SmartClean's proprietary BI services.
- Web Report: These reports are snapshots of data and analytics at a certain time. Such reports can be shared with users not having Matrix logins.
- Document Report (PDF): These reports are available as a PDF document that can be shared with users over various communication mediums.

## How can you find out the type of Report
*The icon shown under the column: Report Type, corresponding to each report controller represents the
type of report this controller represents*

- For BI Reports the icon is a small box with ">_" inside it
- For Web Reports, the icon is a small globe (representing the web)
- For Document Reports, the icon is a small image of a document or file
