# What are the Report Types
*Depending on who are the intended users and the service which provides the data, this service can generate reports of various types.*

Our reporting service shows three types of reports:
- BI Embedded (Business Intelligence): These reports allow custom analytics and data to be presented using SmartClean's proprietary BI services.
- Web Report: These reports are snapshots of data and analytics at a certain time. Such reports can be shared with users not having Matrix logins.
- PDF Report (Document): These reports are available as a PDF document that can be shared with users over various communication mediums.
