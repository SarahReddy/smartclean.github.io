## What is SmartClean VCS
*The Virtual Cleaning Supervisor is a system that generates Work Orders for desired events in locations where SmartClean devices are installed.*

This system is responsible for creating [Work Orders](/workorders.html) to raise alert about a desired event for a use case, subject to various [VCS Settings]() at the Facility, Location and Device level.


The Work orders generated by VCS will show up in the Work Orders section of your application

Link to the Web Dashboard or Mobile Applications are available on the [SmartClean Matrix page](/index.html)
