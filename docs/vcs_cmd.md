# Consumable Monitoring Solution
*This solution generates an Alert when the fill level of the consumable being monitored has dropped below a set level*

Examples of consumables that can be monitored with this Solution:
1. Toilet Roll (standard toilet roll enclosure that fits our criteria for sensor installation)
2. Paper Towel (container to stack paper napkins, that fits our criteria for sensor installation)
3. Soap Solution (any soap solution container that fits our criteria for sensor installation)

## How does this Solution work
To activate our Consumable Monitoring Solution, the following steps are required.

1. Install and activate SmartClean Consumable Monitoring Sensor (of a specific type) at desired Location in your Facility.
   - For Example: Install and activate a Soap Solution level sensor inside each soap solution container for monitoring the fill level.
   
2. Define details of recipients who should receive notifications about consumable level getting low events.
   - For Example: A cleaning attendant to receive SMS and supervisor to receive Mobile App Notification

3. Done! Your Locations can now raise an Alert when fill level of desired consumable has reached the configured minimum level for that sensor.
