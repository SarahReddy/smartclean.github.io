# Feedback Reporting Solution
*This solution is used to keep a record of all feedback given on the feedback reporting device*
Feedback can be good or bad depending on the rating.
For feedback with bad rating, a set of standard reasons is also obtained.

This solution generates an alert when anyone gives bad feedback using the feedback reporting device installed in your Location.*

## How does this Solution work
To activate our Feedback Reporting Solution, the following steps are required.

1. Install and activate SmartClean Feedback Tablet at a desired Location in your Facility.
   - For Example: Install and activate one Feedback Tablet around entrance of desired Washroom to allow users to give feedback.
   
2. Define details of recipients who should receive notifications about bad feedback events
   - For Example: A cleaning attendant to receive SMS and supervisor to receive Mobile App Notification

3. Done! Your Locations can now raise an Alert when a user gives any bad feedback using the Feedback Tablet.
