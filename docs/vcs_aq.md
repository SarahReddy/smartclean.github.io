# Indoor air quality monitoring solution
*This solution generates an alert when any source of bad air quality is detected within range of the sensor*

## How does this solution work
To activate our indoor air quality monitoring solution, the following steps are required.

1. Install and activate SmartClean air quality sensor at desired enclosed locations in your facility.
   - For example: install and activate one air quality Sensor inside desired zone to monitor the indoor air quality.
   
2. Define details of recipients who should receive notifications about bad air quality
   - For example: People to receive SMS and mobile app notification

3. Your location will raise an alert when our solution determines the air quality is unexpected for a certain period.

4. The alert indicates that the indoor air quality is bad or not suitable for the area.
