# What are Report Actions  

![Matrix-Report(Actions)](https://www.smartclean.io/matrix/images/reportsHome.png)

Actions available on each report are shown as icon buttons in the same row as the report, under the Actions column.

Common Report actions are as follows:
1. **Execute Report:** 
   - Run the report to populate it with latest or custom data.
   - The button looks a triangle pointing right inside a circle (or a Play button)
2. **View or Share Report:**
   - View the generated report or share it with other people (in specific formats available)
   - The button looks like the image of an eye
3. **View or Edit Report Details:**
   - View and Edit details for the Report.
   - The button looks like a share icon (box with arrow pointing outwards)
