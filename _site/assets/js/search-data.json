    "content": "The purpose of Matrix Event Bus (MEB) is to stream events from various applications running in a property or organisation and deliver it to certain endpoints on a near-real time basis. Subscribers can subscribe to a pattern (subset) or entirety of events. Billing is calculated based on the amount of data egress and certain other key parameters of deliveries. Using MEB, third party application developers can plugin their solutions within Matrix and add value within the eco-system. For example, an application listening to all incident creations can notify another application within their organisation about the same by subscribing to a pattern: . matrix.&lt;mybuildingid&gt;.scworkforcemanagement.INCIDENT_CREATED.* . What are events ? . Each application within Matrix, when it acts on certain key entities, results in a create, modify, delete or read event with respect to the namespace within that application. For example, when a new incident is created within Matrix, its RoutingKey is as follows: matrix.mybuildingid.scworkforcemanagement.INCIDENT_CREATED.HIGH . Additionally, an event will also contain a generally complete subset of affected object’s data for providing minimal information about the event. For example, a new incident creation event will also proxy the details about the zone, name of task, who it is allocated to. Any other information not present within the event payload can be obtained by appropriate SDK calls to Matrix. The routing key of an event has the following generic schema: . matrix.&lt;principal&gt;.&lt;module&gt;.&lt;eventid&gt;.&lt;priority&gt; . Can I generate events from my application and send it to MEB ? . Yes, third party applications can generate their own events within the event bus, subject to certain restrictions and quotas. ",

    "content": ". | Do Workorders include both incidents and scheduled tasks? Yes. | Why do time interval-based graphs like “No. Of Workorders” have different time intervals depending on the interval chosen while generating the report? It is done to facilitate easy viewing and better data ranges depending on the time interval chosen. So basically: . | If the chosen date range is for a single day, then the data points shown are on an Hourly Basis. | If the chosen date range is less than a month, then the data points shown are on Daily Basis. | If the chosen date range is more than a month but less than 3 months, then the data points shown are on Weekly Basis. | If the chosen date range is more than 3 months, then the data points shown are on a Monthly Basis. The maximum date range is that of 190 Days for a report that can be provided. | . | In the type of graphs mentioned in the previous question, if the date range chosen while generating the report is from 3 Jan to 15 April which means the interval of the graphs will be on monthly basis(Because the number of days is more than 3 months). In that, the data presented in “No. Of Workorders” for the month of April is for the whole of April or only till the 15th of April? Data shown is always according to the interval provided while generating the report. So even if the column is showing April month in the time range. The data statistics shown is only till 15th of April. | . ",

Note: SMARTCLEAN#PPLCTR considers the direction, therefore, it provides the number of people entering the sensor’s field of view in count and number of people leaving the field of view in out_count . SMARTCLEAN#UM is triggered by motion, therefore it provides the number of times people entering the sensor’s field of view in count. An example use case is to raise an alert when value of count reaches or crosses a maximum threshold. An example query that returns the total people count for a time range across all the zones in a building is as follows: . select insid as Zone, sum(cast(v-&gt;&gt;'count' as integer)) TotalPeople from &lt;db.table&gt; where pid = '&lt;pid&gt;' and month = '&lt;month&gt;' and dom = '&lt;dom&gt;' and devtype = 'SMARTCLEAN#PPLCTR' and time &gt;= &lt;Start Time&gt; and time &lt;= &lt;End Time&gt; group by insid; . Feedback Device . Device slot type applicable: . | SMARTCLEAN#FD | . Format of v in the general data format: . { \"rating\": &lt;number&gt;, // From 1 - 5 \"reasons\": { // optionally present &lt;reason id&gt;: { \"Name\": &lt;string&gt;, // Reason Name/Description \"selector\": &lt;number&gt; // A constant for aggregation purposes }, ... } } . Where key rating depicts the rating provided by the user. This results in a standard metric emission of sg.smartclean.fd.raw.rating. The value of rating is ordered in lesser the better ordering, i.e. value of 1 indicates excellent, 2 indicates good and in this manner the value of 5 indicates very bad. An example use case is to raise an alert when the value of rating is either 4 or 5 (which indicates bad feedback). The alert can also include the values of reasons that are given in the data. Note the name of reason is included inside the data for the corresponding reason id. An example query that returns the average user rating for a time range across all the zones in a building is as follows . select insid as Zone, avg(cast(v-&gt;&gt;'rating' as integer)) AverageRating from &lt;db.table&gt; where pid = '&lt;pid&gt;' and month = '&lt;month&gt;' and dom = '&lt;dom&gt;' and devtype = 'SMARTCLEAN#FD' and time &gt;= &lt;Start Time&gt; and time &lt;= &lt;End Time&gt; group by insid; . Consumable and Bin Level Monitoring Devices . Device slot types applicable: . | SMARTCLEAN#TR (Toilet Roll monitoring Device) | SMARTCLEAN#PT (Paper Towel monitoring Device) | SMARTCLEAN#SS (Soap Solution monitoring Device) | SMARTCLEAN#BIN (Bin container monitoring Device) | . The above types refer to: Tissue Roll, Paper Towel, Bin, Soap Solution types respectively. Format of v in the general data format: . { \"p\": &lt;number&gt; // Percentage from 0 to 100 } . Based on whether the device type is bin or some other consumable, the value of p represents a slightly different aspect. | For slot type BIN, . | p represents the empty space (remaining) inside the enclosing bin container | . | For the other slot Types (TR, PT and SS), . | p represents the level of consumable remaining in the container. | . | . An example use case is to raise an alert if the value of p reaches below a certain minimum threshold. If the type was bin, this indicates that the bin container is near to getting full. For other consumable types this indicates that the fill level of the consumable is near to getting empty. Spill detection device . Device slot type applicable: . | SMARTCLEAN#WD | . Format of v in the general data format: . { \"value\": &lt;number&gt; // value of 1 represents spill detected. \"AreaP\": &lt;number&gt; // value represents percentage of area that is wet } . An example use case is to raise an alert if the value is 1 and value of AreaP crosses a certain threshold . Air Quality Monitoring Device . Device slot types applicable: . | SMARTCLEAN#ODRDTR | SMARTCLEAN#ODRDTR_BATT_V1 | . Format of v in the general data format: . { \"amm\": &lt;number&gt; // concentration of the ammonia in the detection zone (unit depends on type of device) \"aqi\": &lt;number&gt; // Air Quality Index (number between 1 - 500), only present for ODRDTR_BATT_V1 } . Note: . | aqi is not present in data for the type: ODRDTR | amm the value is in parts per million for ODRDTR and in parts per billion for ODRDTR_BATT_V1 | . An example use case is to raise an alert if value of amm crosses a threshold. aqi can also be used to raise an alert depending on a simple threshold or which range of AQI values it belongs to. ",
